# Autonomous Stair Climbing
The `stair_detection` folder contains a Python wrapper [(courtesy of madhawav)](https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py) modified for our Stair Detection task. Weights of tiny-YOLOv3 trained for this specific purpose are also provided in the same folder.

The annotated dataset used for training and evaluation can be found at [this link](https://goo.gl/FnvNht).
